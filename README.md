# Aeraelia
Aeraelia is a D&amp;D campaign setting of my own creation. It is a world shaped by wars long since fought, lost, and won. A landscape fractured by divine warfare. Floating cities and Airships drift through the skies.
## chasaia
Chasaia is one region in the larger world; Aeraelia. It is a desert region blighted by Cosmic warfare from ages past. A region rich in a special magical substance called Aerithum: a crystaline material made of the condensed Weave&em;pure magice made manifest. It is used to lift ships into the air, to power magical engines, to craft mystical swords.
