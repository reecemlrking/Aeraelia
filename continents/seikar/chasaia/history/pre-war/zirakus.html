        The city of Zirakus was an ancient magocratic city from the 
        first age. Little is known about it today outside of a few 
        remnants which survived the Sunderings. What Arlax has 
        pieced together from various scholars' work is the following:
        <ul>
            <li>Zirakus was founded by the Zirakus family, an ancient family of mages of which little is known.</li>
            <li>The city existed for centuries prior to the first war, but was destroyed/disappeared</li>
            <li>Much of the details of its destruction are lost to time.</li>
            <li>Very few remnants of the city have been discovered.</li>
        </ul>
